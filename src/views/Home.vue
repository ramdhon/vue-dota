    <h1>Defense of the Ancients</h1>
    <p>
      Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mod for the video
      game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne. The
      objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a heavily guarded
      structure at the opposing corner of the map, which is based on the "Aeon of Strife" map for
      StarCraft. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are assisted by allied teammates
      and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games, players level up their heroes and use
      gold to buy equipment during the mission.
