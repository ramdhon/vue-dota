          Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) mod for
          the video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen
          Throne. The objective of the game is for each team to destroy their opponents' Ancient, a
          heavily guarded structure at the opposing corner of the map, which is based on the "Aeon
          of Strife" map for StarCraft. Players use powerful units known as heroes, and are
          assisted by allied teammates and AI-controlled fighters. As in role-playing games,
          players level up their heroes and use gold to buy equipment during the mission.
